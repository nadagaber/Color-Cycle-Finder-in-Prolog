# Color-Cycle-Finder-in-Prolog

## Description
This Prolog project aims to solve the problem of finding color cycles in a given NÃ—M grid. Each cell in the grid contains one of three colors: Red, Yellow, or Blue. The goal is to identify and print any cycles of cells where:
 - All cells in the cycle have the same color.
 - The cycle consists of four distinct, adjacent cells.
 - The cells form a closed loop.
 - The project uses uninformed search algorithms (Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) to explore the grid and find such cycles.
